### What is `sequence_handling` for?

`sequence_handling` is a series of scripts to automate and speed up DNA sequence aligning and quality control through the use of our workflow outlined here. This repository contains two general kinds of scripts: *Shell Scripts* and *Batch Submission Scripts*, with one exception.

The former group is designed to be run directly from the command line. These serve as partial dependency installers, a way to generate a list for batch submission, QSub starters, and others that have issues with either running in parallel or using the [_Portable Batch System_](http://www.pbsworks.com/) due to memory issues. Running any of these scripts without any arguments generates a usage message for more details. Each script is named entirely in lower-case letters.

The latter group is designed to run the workflow in batch and in parallel. These scripts use a list of sequences, with full sequence paths, as their input and utilize [_GNU Parallel_](http://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/) to speed up the analysis and work they are designed for. Due to the length of time and resources needed for these scripts to run, they are designed to be submitted to a job scheduler, specifically the [_Portable Batch System_](http://www.pbsworks.com/). Each script is named using capital and lower-case letters.

Finally, there is one script that is neither designed to run directly from the shell nor submitted to a job scheduler. This script, `plot_cov.R` is designed to be called by `Plot_Coverage.sh` for creating coverage plots. This is done automatically; one does not need to change this script unless they wish to change the graphing parameters.

> **NOTE:** the latter group of scripts and `read_mapping_start.sh` are designed to use the [_Portable Batch System_](http://www.pbsworks.com/) and run on the [Minnesota Supercomputing Institute](https://www.msi.umn.edu). Heavy modifications will need to be made if not using these systems.

### Why use list-based batch submission?

Piping one sample alone through this workflow can take over 12 hours to completely run. Most sequence handling jobs are not dealing with one sample, so the amount of time to run this workflow increases drastically. List-based batch submission simplifies the amount of typing that one has to do, and enables parallel processing to decrease time spent waiting for samples to finish. An example list is shown velow

>/home/path\_to\_sample/sample\_001\_R1.fastq.gz

>/home/path\_to\_sample/sample\_001\_R2.fastq.gz

>/home/path\_to\_sample/sample\_003_R1.fastq.gz

>/home/path\_to\_sample/sample\_003\_R2.fastq.gz


### Why use parallel processing?

Parallel processing decreases the amount of time by running multiple jobs at once and keeping track of which are done, which are running, and which have yet to be run. This workflow, with the list-based batch submissions and parallel processing, both simplifies and quickens the process of sequence handling.

### Do I have to use the entire workflow as is?

No, with the one exception of `Plot_Coverage.sh` and `plot_cov.R`, no two scripts are entirely dependent on one another. While all these scripts are designed to easily use the output from one to the next, these scripts are not required to achive the end result of `sequence_handling`. If you prefer tools other than the ones used within this workflow, you can modify or replace any or all of the scripts offered in `sequence_handling`. This creates a pseudo-modularity for the entire workflow that allows for customization for each and every user.

### Dependencies

Due to the pseudo-modularity of this workflow, specific dependencies for each individual script are listed below. Some general dependencies for the workflow as a whole are listed here:

 - A quality trimmer, such as [_Seqqs_](https://github.com/morrelllab.seqqs), [_Sickle_](https://github.com/vsbuffalo/sickle), and [_Scythe_](https://github.com/vsbuffalo/scythe)
 - Tools for plotting results, such as [_R_](http://cran.r-project.org/)
 - SAM file processing utilities, such as [_SAMTools_](http://www.htslib.org/) and [_Picard_](http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/)
 - A quality control mechanism, such as [_FastQC_](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)
 - A read mapper, such as [_The Burrows-Wheeler Aligner_](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/) (BWA)
 - [_GNU Parallel_](http://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/)

Please note that this is not a complete list of dependencies. Check below for specific dependencies for each desired script.

When running these scripts on the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute's (MSI) resources, most dependencies are included through MSI's module system. These modules are set to be automatically called by each script that calls upon them. However, some dependencies are not available through MSI; please check each script for which dependencies need to be installed separately.

## Other Scripts

### plot\_cov.R

The `plot_cov.R` script is the graphical brains behind the `Plot_Coverage.sh` script. The latter will automatically call upon the former to create the coverage plots based off coverage maps. It is not necessary to open this script directly, except for making modifications to the graphical parameters.

##### dependencies

The `plot_cov.R` script has no external dependencies.
