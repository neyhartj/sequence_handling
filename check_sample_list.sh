Usage:  ./$0 sample_info \n\
where:  'sample_info' is a file containing a list of samples \n\
\n\
$0 is designed to check a sample list to ensure that it is properly formatted \n\
for use with sequence_handling. There are two checks run in this script: \n\
    First, we check to make sure files exist. The best way to ensure that a \n\
        sample list passes this check is to use full file paths for each sample \n\
        in the list.
    Second, we check to make sure all samples have unique names. We use the names given \n\
        to each sample to name subsequent files; if any have the same name, outfiles will be \n\
        overwritten. We check this to make sure no files are overwritten while using sequence_handling \n\
