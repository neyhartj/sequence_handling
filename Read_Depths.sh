#   This script is a QSub submission for calculating the read depths of a batch of samples
#   To use, on line 5, change the 'user@example.com' to your own email address
#       to get notifications on start and completion for this script
#   Add the full file path to list of samples on the 'SAMPLE_INFO' field on line 38
#       This should look like:
#           SAMPLE_INFO=${HOME}/Directory/list.txt
#       Use ${HOME}, as it is a link that the shell understands as your home directory
#           and the rest is the full path to the actual list of samples
#   Put the full directory path for the output in the 'SCRATCH' field on line 41
#       This should look like:
#           SCRATCH="${HOME}/Out_Directory
#       Adjust for your own out directory.
#   Name the project in the 'PROJECT' field on line 44
#       This should look lke:
#           PROJECT=Barley
#       The full output path will be ${SCRATCH}/${PROJECT}/Read_Depths
#   Define the target size for your samples in the 'TARGET' field on line 47
#       This should look like:
#           TARGET=60000000
#   Run the script using the qsub command
#       qsub
#   This script outputs a text file with all of the read depths for each sample within it.
