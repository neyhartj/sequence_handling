#   This script is a QSub submission for generating a coverage map for a batch of BAM files.
#   To use, on line 5, change the 'user@example.com' to your own email address
#       to get notifications on start and completion for this script
#   Define a path to the bedtools in the 'BEDTOOLS' field on line 47
#       If using MSI, leave the definition as is to use their installation of bedtools
#       Otherwise, it should look like this:
#           BEDTOOLS=${HOME}/software/bedtools
#       Please be sure to comment out (put a '#' symbol in front of) the 'module load bedtools' on line 46
#       And to uncomment (remove the '#' symbol) from lines 47 and 48
#   Add the full file path to list of samples on the 'SAMPLE_INFO' field on line 51
#       This should look like:
#           SAMPLE_INFO=${HOME}/Directory/list.txt
#       Use ${HOME}, as it is a link that the shell understands as your home directory
#           and the rest is the full path to the actual list of samples
#   Name the project in the 'PROJECT' field on line 54
#       This should look lke:
#           PROJECT=Genetics
#   Put the full directory path for the output in the 'SCRATCH' field on line 57
#       This should look like:
#           SCRATCH="${HOME}/Out_Directory"
#       Adjust for your own out directory.
#   Define a reference annotation file for the coverage mapping process in the 'REF_ANN' field on line 61
#       This should look like:
#           REF_ANN=${HOME}/Directory/annotation.bed
#       This can be either a BED file or a GFF file
#   Run this script using the qsub command
#       qsub Coverage_Map.sh
#   This script outputs a text file for each sample

#   Path to BEDTools
#   On MSI, loading the module works
#   Otherwise, have path to BEDTools directory
