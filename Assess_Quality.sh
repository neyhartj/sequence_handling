#   This script is a QSub submission for running FastQC on a batch of files.
#   To use, on line 5, change the 'user@example.com' to your own email address
#       to get notifications on start and completion for this script
#   Add the full file path to list of samples on the 'SAMPLE_INFO' field on line 46
#       This should look like:
#           SAMPLE_INFO=${HOME}/Directory/list.txt
#       Use ${HOME}, a shell environmental variable that returns the path to your home directory
#           and the rest is the full path to the actual list of samples
#   Name the project in the 'PROJECT' field on line 49
#       This should look lke:
#           PROJECT=Barley
#   Put the full directory path for the output in the 'SCRATCH' field on line 52
#       This should look like:
#           SCRATCH="${HOME}/Out_Directory"
#       The full OUT directory path will be ${SCRATCH}/${PROJECT}/Quality_Assesment
#       Adjust for your own OUT directory.
#   If NOT using MSI's resources, define a path to a FastQC installation on line 56
#       Uncomment (remove the '#' symbol) lines 56 and 57
#       and comment (add a '#" symbol to the front of) line 55
#       This should look like
#           #module load fastqc
#           FASTQC_DIR=${HOME}/path_to_fastqc
#           export PATH=$PATH/${FASTQC_DIR}
#   Run this script using the qsub command
#       qsub FastQC.sh
#   This script outputs an HTML file and a .zip archive for every sample run
#   Suggested post-processing is to run FasterQC on the HTML files to create one
#       PNG image of the output. See more at
#   http://msi-riss.readthedocs.org/en/latest/software/riss_util.html#fasterqc-pl
