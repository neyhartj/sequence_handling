#   This script is a QSub submission for quality trimming a batch of files.
#   To use, on line 5, change the 'user@example.com' to your own email address
#       to get notifications on start and completion for this script
#   Place the full directory path to the Sequence Handling directory on line 66
#       This should look like:
#           SEQUENCE_HANLDING=${HOME}/sequence_handling
#       Use ${HOME}, as it is a link that the shell understands as your home directory
#   Add the full file path to list of samples on the 'SAMPLE_INFO' field on line 69
#       This should look like:
#           SAMPLE_INFO=${HOME}/Directory/list.txt
#   Specify the forward and reverse file extensions in the 'FORWARD_NAMING'
#       and 'REVERSE_NAMING' fields on lines 75 and 76
#       This should look like:
#           FORWARD_NAMING=_1_sequence.txt.gz
#           REVERSE_NAMING=_2_sequence.txt.gz
#   Name the project in the 'PROJECT' field on line 79
#       This should look lke:
#           PROJECT=Barley
#   Put the full directory path for the output in the 'SCRATCH' field on line 82
#       This should look like:
#           SCRATCH="${HOME}/Out_Directory"
#       Adjust for your own OUT directory.
#   List the adapters file on line 85
#       This should look like:
#           ADAPTERS=${HOME}/adapters.fa
#   Define the prior for Scythe on line 89
#       This should look like:
#           PRIOR=0.04
#   Set Sickle's quality threshold on line 94
#       This should look like:
#           THRESHOLD=20
#       Use 20 for normal trimming and 0 for no trimming
#   Define the platform usied for sequencing on line 97
#       This should look like:
#           PLATFORM=sanger
#   Define the R installation on line 101
#       If using MSI, leave the definition as is to use their installation of R
#       Otherwise, it should look like this:
#           R=${HOME}/software/R
#       Please be sure to comment out (put a '#' symbol in front of) the 'module load R' on line 100
#       And to uncomment (remove the '#' symbol) from lines 101 and 102
#   Run this script using the qsub command
#       qsub Quality_Trimming.sh
#   This script outputs gzipped FastQ files with the extension fq.qz
#   In the stats directory, there are text files with more details about the trimming
#       as well as a plots directory
#   In the plots directory, there are PDFs showing graphs of the quality before and after the trim
#   Finally, this script outputs a list of all trimmed FastQ files for use in the Read_Mapping.sh script
#       This is stored in ${SCRATCH}/${PROJECT}/Quality_Trimming, with the path dependent on how you name these fields.
